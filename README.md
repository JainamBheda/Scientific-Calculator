### Site is live at https://jainambheda.github.io/Scientific-Calculator/

This project implements a simple scientific calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides standard arithmetic operations along with trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, memory and other sceintic functions like permutation and combination

## Features

- Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

- Scientific Functions: Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), Logarithms (log, ln), Exponentiation (^),Inverse trigonometric Functions(asin,acos,atan) , hyperbolic functions

- Memory Functions: Memory store (M+), Memory recall (MR), Memory clear (MC)

- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

## Installation and Usage

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JainamBheda/sceintic-Calculator.git
```

- Navigate into the project directory
```bash
cd scientific-calculator
```
- Open "index.html" in a web browser.

## How to Use
- Enter numbers and perform operations using the on-screen buttons.

- Use the keyboard for numeric input and basic operations (+, -, *, /).

- For scientific functions, click on the respective buttons (e.g., sin, cos, sqrt).

- Memory functions (M+, MR, MC) are available for storing, recalling, and clearing memory values.

- for permutation and combination enter two number in format "n,r" and then click on nPr for permutation and nCr for combination
